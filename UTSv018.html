# Introduction
:
At its core, this system is about empowering both **Players** and **GMs** to create and explore whatever world they desire. Whether you're looking to play in a high-fantasy realm filled with magic and dragons, a gritty post-apocalyptic wasteland, or a futuristic sci-fi utopia, this system is designed to accommodate any setting, genre, or play style. With a focus on character growth and Player agency, this system encourages creativity and freedom, allowing Players to truly inhabit the characters they create and experience the stories that unfold.

This system is not about punishing Players for making the "wrong" choices, or forcing them down a pre-determined path. Instead, it's about giving Players the tools they need to build the characters they want to play, without being limited by rigid rules or arbitrary restrictions. With a flexible and intuitive approach to character progression, Players can create unique and interesting characters that reflect their own personalities and play styles. Meanwhile, GMs are able to craft worlds and narratives that challenge and engage Players, without getting bogged down in complicated mechanics or obscure rules.


This book will be divided into three distinct sections, parts one and two will be dedicated to Players; how they can interact with and utilize the available systems to create and play their ideal character.

The part three is devoted to the GM.  It will include instructions on how to guide Players along their journey, and craft the setting to any desired format, as well as several templates based off of popular settings as examples.
:
**TL;DR** this system is about giving **Players** and **GMs** the freedom to explore and create without being held back by unnecessary restrictions. 


### Keywords

Throughout The Book there will be words highlighted **in bold**.  These words are **Keywords** and have a very specific meaning within this system.  Definitions for any terms you are unsure of can be located in the **Glossary** in the back of this book.

### How to Play

**Part 1** of this book offers a step-by-step example of how to create a character, as well as the basic functions of the game.  You'll learn how the **5** **Ability Scores** work, how to create **Skills** and **Equipment** for your character, and how **Powers** can be used to perform special **Actions** during gameplay.
:
**Part 2** will teach you how to use the character you've created in-game.  You'll learn how both the **Roleplaying** and **Combat** systems work, how to create **Powers** to customize your character, and the general rules of **Adventuring**.

### What you will need to play

#### Dice
This system mostly uses **d4s**, **d6s**, **d8s**, **d10s**, and **d12s**. **d20s** are also used, but uncommonly.

# Chapter 1: Character Creation
:
In Unnamed Tabletop System (UTS), you have free reign to create whatever characters you desire.  This system is not set into any one genre or world, so the characters you can create are limited only by your imagination and (ideally) the setting or scenario you are playing in.  
You could be..
- A noble knight, Cast Out of their ancestral home by a great evil, eternally questing to return their family and name to its former glory.
- An intrepid explorer living at the edges of known space, seeking new life and experiences in strange unexplored worlds.
- A sentient doorframe, created in ages long past for a mighty wizard, now having been ripped out of the wall by a rag-tag group of adventurers to be sold for drinking money.
- A young scion of a strong but forgotten race, now wandering the stars and seeking challenges to increase your strength, striving toward the legendary lost powers your people were known for.
- An anime protagonist, who somehow manages to be both incredibly powerful and charming, while also having no common sense or awareness.
- A young prodigy born into a small village, destined for greatness and knowing in your heart you will one day become a leader to your people.
- A powerful mage, hidden away for centuries, now emerging from your tower to find someone has stolen your doorframe.
- A baby boy, sent away from a dying world by his loving parents to land on a small but interesting planet far-far away.
- A black-ops soldier, pinned down and out of ammo, only to be suddenly transported and dropped into a strange and unnerving fantasy land.

As an example, we will follow a step-by-step creation process for an orc named Glorg.


### Step 1: Choose a Profession
:
The first step in creating your character is to choose a **Profession**. Scary, I know, but your Profession is essentially your character's class or occupation, and it will determine what skills and abilities your character begins with. Your Profession is also a reflection of your character's background and the role they play in the game world.  

Take some time to think about your character's background and what kind of Profession would be a good fit for them. Maybe your character is a skilled blacksmith, a cunning thief, or a powerful wizard. You'll want to choose a name for your Profession that reflects your character's role and gives a sense of their expertise.  

Perhaps you're a mighty sorcerer, but since your character has had an affinify for fire since birth, having been born under a fateful star, your Profession is Pyromancer.  Or maybe you're a chivalrous knight, sworn to protect the light and all within it from those that dwell in shadow, and so you become a Dawnguard. Use your Profession as the first opportunity to add personality to your character and their background.  

Consider the setting you'll be playing in and think about how your Profession fits into that world.
For example, if you're playing in a medieval fantasy world, a knight or a cleric might be appropriate choices. If you're playing in a modern spy thriller, a secret agent or hacker might be more fitting.

#### It's Glorgin' Time
To begin making Glorg, we will make his Profession that of a Painter, as Glorg is a gentle orcish man simply enamored by the beauty of nature.

###### Check **Appendix A** for some example Professions.


### Step 2: Define Your Build
:
After selecting a Profession, the next step in character creation is to determine your character's **Ability Scores**. Every player character (PC), non-player character (NPC), or otherwise (?) in this system has a set of Ability Scores that define their various strengths and weaknesses. They are: **Prowess**, **Fortitude**, **Determination**, and **Wit**.





#### Health and Life Points

Your **Health** represents your ability to withstand damage. You can think of it as a barrier between your character and any harm that would be done to them. 

Having more Health will mean you can stay in the fight longer or survive long enough to escape, however running out of Health does not mean you are out of the fight entirely.  

At **0** Health you will still be able to participate, take your turn normally, and can still be healed, but you will lose **Life Points**.

Each character begins with **5**+**1d10** Health, reroll any 1s.

Characters can gain more Health by investing in Fortitude and Determination, or by winning battles.

**See Step 8: Progression for more information on gaining additional Health.**



##### Life Points

Life Points (**LP**) represent your body's accrual of injuries and ability to continue adventuring.  Each new character will begin the game with **4 LP**.  


{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter 1 | CHARACTER CREATION}}
\page


Every time you take damage that brings you to or below **0** Health you will lose 1 LP.

Once you have reached 0 LP you will be too wounded to continue participating, will be considered helpless, and can die.  You will be unable to Move or perform Actions while helpless. LP cannot be conventionally healed, but you will recover 1 LP while taking a Long Rest (8+ hour).


#### Focus

Focus is a resource that represents your character's ability to concentrate and utilize their mental or physical energies. It can be spent to gain bonuses to dice rolls or activate powerful abilities, but must be managed carefully to avoid reprecussions.
:
To spend **Focus**, simply declare that you are doing so, and the amount you are spending prior to making a dice roll or using a **Power**. For each extra point of Focus spent, you gain a **+1** bonus to your roll, up to the maximum value of the dice being rolled. If you have spent Focus and reached the maximum value of a die, you may continue rolling by Cascading until you run out of Focus or choose to end the Cascade. However, any unspent Focus used in this way is lost until you recover.
:
Running out of Focus, or having negative Focus, will cause your character to become mentally drained until they regain clarity.  They may still use **Actions**, but their ***Ability Scores are halved during this time***.  A character's **Focus** will recover by **1d4** per round until they reach a value greater than **0**.

Spent **Focus** will recover **to 1/2 of your maximum total Focus** at the end of a battle or after a short rest, but will not fully recover without a Long Rest. 

Each character begins the game with **10** Focus.

Characters can gain more Focus by investing in Wit and Determination, or by succeeding at Skill Challenges.

**See Step 8: Progression for more information on gaining extra Focus.**

{{note
**Focus is an extremely important gameplay mechanic.  Players are strongly encouraged to use Focus to improve their rolls, but should understand that spending any Focus comes with the risk of not having it at a later time.**
}}

#### Speed
Your **Speed** is a resource that determines how many **Squares** you can Move in **Combat**.  

During your **Turn** you may spend your Speed to **Move** or utilize any abilities that use Speed as their resource, however if you run out of Speed you will not be able to Move for the rest of that Round.


\column

##### Ability Score Summary
{{background:yellow
###### Prowess 
}}

}}
{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter 1 | CHARACTER CREATION}}
\page
### Step 3: Determine Ability Scores
:
##### Option 1: Rolling Dice

You can choose to determine your starting scores randomly by rolling **4d6** for each Ability Score, keeping the highest **3** values each time, and repeating this process for each Ability Score.

You may use the rolled values in whatever order you choose, however there are **no rerolls**.

##### Option 2: Point Buy

Rather than leaving your creation up to fate you can decide upon your characters starting Ability Scores as you see fit.


When picking this method, each Ability Score will begin at a value of **5** (5 Prowess, 5 Fortitude, 5 Determination, & 5 Wit).  

You will have **25** points to spend on your Ability Scores, but **15** is the highest an Ability Score can end up at.

##### Option 3: Pick an Array

If you're not in favor of leaving your Ability Scores up to chance, or trying to determine the best possible arrangement of your points, or are simply trying to speed this all up, you can choose one of the following sets of scores to assign to your character:

* Standard Array (**15, 12, 10, 8**)

* Min-Max Array (**15, 15, 10, 5**)

* Average Array (**12, 11, 11, 11**)

:
#### It's Still Glorgin' Time.

Now that we've learned some things about Ability Scores and what they represent, we are ready to choose Glorg's scores.  We'll go with Option 2: Point Buy.  

Glorg, as a Painter, has devoted his life to learning the art of... well, art.  He seeks to capture the beauty of all he sees and see all that appears beautiful to him.  We'll need scores that can help him reach this goal, and since he's a painter we'll put his highest score in Perception (**15**).  Since Glorg has been travelling, he's certainly learned a few things, so his next highest score will be Wit (**13**).  Art can be time consuming and requires a steady hand, so Glorg will have Prowess (**10**) and Determination (**10**) as his next choices.  Finally, Glorg is more of a lover than a fighter, and so his lowest score will be Fortitude (**7**).

### Step 4: Equipment
:
Your character's starting equipment will be chosen and designed by you. You may begin the game with up to 3 pieces of **Equipment** from **Chapter 5**.  These can be any combination of **Armor** and **Weapons** you'd like, but should be something that fits the scenario you will be playing in.
:
Your GM may choose to give you additional **Currency** and **Items** to begin the game with, depending on what kind of game you are playing.

#### Armor and Defense

Your character's chosen Armor adds to your **Defense** and will be used to help determine if you are successfully hit by an **Attack**.  If you are not wearing any Armor or carrying a shield you will only add **1d4** to your Defense. 

#### Weapons and Attacks

Each Weapon you carry will have an Attack value that when rolled will be compared to the Defense of your target.  When Attacking you will roll the dice associated with your Weapon and add your Prowess Modifier to each die that is rolled.  If your Attack is higher then their Defense, then you have successfully hit your target, and any additional Effects will apply.
:
**You can learn more about Equipment and Combat in Part 2 of this book.**

#### Is it Glorgin' Time? Again?

Glorg will wield his trusty Warbrush, a **Large Weapon** (**1d12**), to ensure he can truly capture the grand scale and scope of the beauty he finds, but also drive off any interlopers should it become necessary.  It is, of course, magical, and never runs out of ink or paint.  To Defend himself, Glorg wears **Light Armor** (**1d6**) consisting of a simple leather vest, leather trousers, and a ratty paperboy cap.

### Step 5: Choose Your Skills
:
A **Skill** represents your character's specific knowledge or ability, and is the measure of that knowledge or ability to perform a task. A Skill can be a learned ability, an action you can perform well given an amount of time and energy, or both. 

As your character has a Profession, they are considered to be a professional in that field, and will have a number of Skills (**3**) that they have gained through that Profession.  Your GM may choose to assign additional Skills to you before you begin.

Decide on or design **3** different Skills for your character to have, and assign them all **Expertise**.  If you need help, many examples can be found in **Appendix B: Example Skills**.

#### Training and Expertise

 Being **Trained** in a Skill adds a bonus **1d4**, as you have the requisite knowledge to perform that Skill at a greater level than someone untrained.

As an expert you should be *at least* twice as capable as an untrained person, and so having **Expertise** adds a bonus **1d10** to a Skill roll.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter 1 | CHARACTER CREATION}}
\page

#### It's Glorgin' Time.  Again.

For Glorg's Skills we are going to choose Painting, Studying, and Graffiti.

* *Painting* - Glorg, being a master painter, is of course adept at painting.   Glorg can use a painting roll in order to perhaps paint a map of a dungeon on memory, with a higher roll being a higher magnitude of detail.  Or perhaps you need a likeness of an evil teleporting guy who stole your lunch money in order to make some wanted posters.  Maybe you want to create some high quality landscape pieces to attempt to sell in between adventures?

* *Research* - Behind every great artist is the knowledge of what they are depicting.  Glorg, having spent countless hours in the library and in the field studying anatomy, nature, and basically anything you can feasibly look at, is pretty good at finding knowledge.  You can use a Research roll in order to spend some time sat down, finding information you would otherwise not know.  Need more information on an obscure minor god the GM already forgot they made?  Go to the library and roll a die!  That'll teach 'em to not come to the session prepared.  Research rolls can also be used to investigate things in close detail, like taking a mental inventory of the equipment of a foe.

* *Words of Power: Graffiti* - This one is a little more creative.  Rather than simply being something you are good at that you roll to perform with, it's an actual magical skill.  Glorg can use his Graffiti to draw a word in the form of graffiti in the air in front of him.  Any word he writes takes on the properties of the word.  For instance, the word "Water" would immediately take on all the properties of water and splash to the ground, "Trampoline" could be used to propel yourself upwards, "Shovel" would rearrange the letter to form the silhouette of a fine spade.  A roll might not be needed in order to use the skill for roleplay or basic utility, but to truly affect the world a roll must be made to see if the word is, for example, usable as a weapon (damage will be low as paint is not exactly powerful material), or otherwise if the GM deems a check necessary. 

More information on Skills and their uses can be found in **Chapter 2: Skills**.

### Step 6: Describe Your Character
:
Now that we know the basics about our character it's time to determine who they are as a person.  If you don't already have a name, that's the best place to begin.  Once you have that ready, take a few minutes to consider what they look like and what kind of personality they have.

If you'd like, write up a background for how they came to be here, and what their motivation is to be part of the scenario.**I want to include some basic tables in the back to help players with no imagination.  Some easy questions to fill out a backstory, some rollable tables if they cannot pick motivations or personalities, etc.**


### Step 7: Create your Powers
:
At creation, your character will be given up to **3** unique **Powers** that reflect their unique abilities and talents. Powers can take many forms, from magical spells and elemental attacks to martial techniques and psionic powers. 

You should follow the steps in the **Power Creation** chapter to proceed, but if this is your first time playing you can also check out **Appendix C: Example Powers** to see what you can make before you begin.  There are also quite a few "ready-to-go" powers if you'd like to start with something we've designed.



#### Lets Do The Time Glorg Agaaain

Glorg's three Powers are:
* *Summon Ukiyo-e Wolf*: Summons a wolf painted by Glorg in the Ukiyo-e style that can follow complex commands and understand, Common but not speak it.
* *Nonobjective Wall*:  Creates a small wall made up of nonobjective art, its colors often take the tone of the surroundings or the person it is protecting.
* *An Expression of Heat*: Empowers a targets' next action with an expressionist burst of flames.

### Step 8: Finish The Owl
:
You made it!  Once you are finished with the previous steps your character is ready to be played.  At this point your **GM** will assign you an amount of **XP** to start with, allowing you to touch up and further customize your Character before gameplay starts.  

You can choose to save this XP if you wish, the're no rush if you aren't sure what you want to use it on.  Whenever you're ready, it can be spent toward anything in the **XP Expenditure** section.

##### For all current tests, players will recieve an additional 30 XP to begin the game with.
:
### Progression
:
Characters will earn experience, or **XP**, by performing tasks in game through combat, roleplay, or other means.  A good indicator for when **XP** would be given is if the situation is at least an even match for your character.  Any earned **XP** can be held onto for as long as you'd like, or spent to upgrade various aspects of your character


{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter 1 | CHARACTER CREATION}}
\page
The amount of **XP** your earn will generally be anywhere from **0**-**10**, with **0 XP** being earned for a situation that presents no challenge whatsoever, 



**3 XP** being the baseline for an even match, and **10 XP** earned for an extremely dangerous or deadly encounter.  


:
Some examples of how **XP** might fluctuate in a situation are:
- **+1 XP** if there are more enemies than allies.
- **+2 XP** with at least **2** times as many enemies as there are allies.
- **+2 XP** per enemy that is stronger* than the players or their allies.
- **+1 XP** if enemies are ready to fight
- **+2 XP** if enemies fully prepared or fortified against attack.
- **+1 XP** if enemies are caught completely unaware.
- **-1 XP** if there are less enemies than allies
- **-2 XP** with less than half as many enemies as allies.
- **-2 XP** per enemy that is weaker* than the players or their allies.

*GM's interpretation
:

Keep in mind that these are just examples, and your GM may choose to award any amount of XP they think a situation calls for, for any number of reasons.
:
#### XP Expenditure
:
Once you've earned some XP, or have created a new character and received your creation bonus, you can use it to 'purchase' anything off the **Advancement Table**.
 

|Advancements|Cost|
|:----------|:--:|
|Increase an **Ability Score** by **1**|**2 XP**|
|Increase **Speed** by 1|**10 XP**|
|Gain **Training** in a **Skill**|**5 XP**|
|Upgrade Training to **Expertise**|**15 XP**|
|**Create** a new **Power**|**5 XP**|
|Add an **Effect** to a **Power** | **5 XP** for each **Effect** added|
|**Level Up** an **Effect** on a **Power** | **5 XP**|
|Gain a **Feat**** | **5 XP** for each **Feat** gained
|Increase a **Power's** dice by **1** step|**3 XP**|
|Increase the **DC** of an **Effect** by 1| **5 XP**, **+5** per increase|



* ***Feats have not been added yet, but I'm getting there, I promise.*

# Chapter 2: Skills
:
**Skills** are learned abilities that can help your character in many different situations. Whether you want to pick a lock or climb a wall, a Skill check can help determine whether or not you are successful. Your character's Skills are yours to choose, and can be determined by their background, training, or personal interests.

For example, a character with a high Fortitude score might excel in *athletics*, *Endurance*, or *survival*, while a character with high Wit might be skilled in *investigation*, *insight*, or *perception*.

There are many different Skills to choose from, and players can create their own if they feel that they fit their character's backstory better. However, for those who are unsure of what Skills to choose, there is also list of "general skills" that provides the most typical examples.

Choosing the right Skills can be crucial to your character's success, and can greatly enhance their abilities in different situations. 

#### Skill Checks
:
It's important to remember that different Skills require different levels of difficulty to succeed. For this reason, a **Difficulty Class** (**DC**) chart is provided to determine how difficult a Skill Check will be. The higher the DC, the more difficult the Skill Check.

To make a Skill Check, players will roll **1d10**, if the result is equal to or greater than the DC, the Skill Check is successful.

#### Training and Expertise
Players can upgrade a Skill in three ways: The first way is to get **Training**, each time you roll for a Skill you are Trained in you will roll **2d10**. 

The second way to upgrade a Skill is to gain **Expertise**, which replaces Training, and allows you to roll **3d10** each time you roll for that Skill.  Expertise can only be gained after the player has already received Training in the skill.


The third way is by increasing your **Wit**, and adding your Wit Bonus (**1d4**) to any Skill you do not already have Expertise in.

# Chapter 3: Power Creation

### Step 1: Choose an Ability Score 
:
Each **Power** is linked to a specific Ability Score (**Prowess, Determination, Fortitude, or Wit**) which determines its strength and the Effects it can have. When creating a Power, the chosen Ability Score will also limit the amount of **XP** that can be spent on that Power.

### Step 2: Select Power Type
:
**Attack Powers** are designed to deal damage or impair opponents in combat.  Attack Powers can be used at range or in melee combat.

To use an Attack Power, the player must make an Attack roll, which is the Power's dice roll, plus any bonuses from their Ability Score Modifiers and Effects. The result is then compared to the target's Defense roll.  If the Attack roll is higher than the Defense roll, the Power successfully hits and its damage or effect is applied.

Non-Prowess aligned Attack Powers have a base dice roll of **1d4**, which increases with the amount of XP invested in the Power, according to the **Chart Name**.

Prowess Attack Powers will use the Weapon a character is wielding as their base dice roll.  If a character is using more than one Weapon, they can choose which one to use for a Power "in the moment."
:

**Defense Powers** are designed to protect the character and their allies from damage or Effects in Combat.  Defense Powers can be used at range, although typically they are used in melee combat.

To use a Defense Power, the player must make a Defense roll, which is the Power's dice roll, plus any bonuses from their Ability Score Modifiers and Effects. The result is then compared to the incoming Attack roll. If the Defense roll is higher than the Attack roll, the Power successfully blocks or mitigates the incoming damage and Effects.

Like Attack Powers, Non-Prowess aligned Defense Powers have a base dice roll of **1d4**, which increases with the amount of XP invested in the Power, according to the **Chart Name**.

Prowess aligned Defense Powers will use a character's Armor as their base dice roll.  If a character is wearing multiple pieces of Defensive Equipment they will all add to the Defense roll.
:

**Utility Powers** are not specifically aligned with combat.  They can be used to affect the battlefield in various ways, such as creating obstacles or buffing allies.

Utility Powers do not have any dice on their own, and therefore they cannot be used to make an Attack roll or Defense roll.

Adding Effects to a Utility Power will allow them to bypass the Defense of a target as though they had been successfully hit.  In other words Utility Powers are more closely aligned with the 'support' or 'crowd control' styles of play.

:

### Step 3: Choose an Action type
:
There are three types of Actions that a Power can use: **Standard, Swift, and Reaction**.
:
**Standard Actions** are the most common type of Action that a character can take. They include Attacking, Defending, and using Powers that require a full turn to activate.
:
**Reactions** can be used in response to any Action taken by another character, and will happen before the Action that triggered the reaction. They are a way to quickly respond to unexpected events or counter an opponent's strategy.

**Reactions** add +1 Focus Cost per Power Level.
:
**Swift Actions** can be used to perform any Action that a Standard Action would, but they take less time to perform and can be used repeatedly without expending the character's entire Turn. However, using many Swift Actions repeatedly will also drastically increase their cost.

**Swift Actions** add +2 Focus Cost per Power Level.
:
**Note**: Using multiple Powers in the same **Turn** will cause their Costs to increase by 50% for each additional Power used, with a minimum increase of **1**.
|Uses|Cost
|:--|:--|
|**1st Power** | **Normal Focus Cost**
|**2nd Power** | **Focus Cost * 1.5**
|**3rd Power** | **Focus Cost * 2**
|**4th Power** | **Focus Cost * 2.5**

:

### Step 4: Choose a Range
:
There are 12 types of Range that can be chosen for a Power: **Self, Melee, Ranged, Arc, Line, Cone, T-Shaped, L-Shaped, Cross, Blast, Plus, and Aura.**
:
Each Range has its own unique advantages and disadvantages that can affect a Power's effectiveness in different situations. It is important to consider the Range of a Power when choosing its other attributes, such as its Action type and Effects. 
:
**Self** range is for powers that only affect the user who activated it. It does not affect any other characters or Targets on the battlefield.  Powers with a Self Range are usually a heal or buff that modifies the user's stats

or abilities, such as increasing their damage output or reducing the damage they take. It is much easier to target yourself with a Power, and so it requires less strain on your resources.

**Self** range Powers subtract **1** Focus Cost per Power Level.
:
**Melee** range allows a character to target within their immediate reach, usually only one Square away. These Powers are typically used in close combat situations, such as when a character is engaged with an opponent. 

Because Melee Powers require the character to be in close proximity to their target, they are often more powerful than other types of powers, but they also come with the risk of being counterattacked more easily. Additionally, Melee Powers are limited to only being able to hit one target at a time, making them less effective against groups of enemies.

**Melee** range Powers add **4x** the normal Ability Score Modifiers
:
**Ranged** Powers can be used from a distance and can Target within **5** Squares on the battlefield. However, they cannot Target any Square adjacent to the user's current position. These powers allow the user to maintain some distance from the enemy, but at a cost of having limited ability to respond to close threats.

**Ranged** Powers are limited to only being able to hit one Target at a time, but add **3x** the normal Ability Score Modifiers.
:
**Arc** Powers hit targets in an area that spans three connected adjacent squares. This shape is typically, but not only, used for melee Attacks and covers a 90-degree angle.

**Arc** Powers add **2x** the normal Ability Score Modifers. 
:
**Line** Powers hit all Targets in a straight line, starting from the user and extending in one direction for **5** Squares. It can hit all targets in a row or column, depending on the orientation of the line.

**Line** Powers have no specific bonuses.
:
**Cone** Powers are a shape that hits all targets in a... cone-shaped area, originating from the user and extending outward in a... cone-like shape.  Yeah.  Cones will Target a pattern of **1-3-5** Squares in the direction you choose.  

The first Square a **Cone** hits will have **2x** the normal Ability Score Modifiers added, while the final set of Squares will have no additional Modifiers added.
:
**T-Shaped** Powers extend from the user and hit targets in a.. T-shaped area, with a pattern of **1-1-3** Squares.  The set of **3** Squares at the 'top' of the **T** will have **2x** the normal Ability Score Modifiers added to them.

:
**Cross** Powers hit all targets in a cross-shaped area, with the user at the center. The cross extends two squares in each cardinal direction from the user, hitting all targets in those squares.

**Blast** Powers sacrifice strength to hit in a larger area, and only **1/2** their total dice roll will apply.
:
**Plus** Powers affect targets in a + shape, and can be centered on any Square Up to a maximum range of **5** Squares away from the user.

**Plus** Powers can also be used diagonally in an x shape.
:
**Aura** Powers normally affect all Squares adjacent to the user, but don't target the user themselves. In other words, it's a point blank area-of-effect attack that affects all enemies or allies within 1 Square of the user, but doesn't damage, defend, or affect the user.

:
### Step 5: Focus Cost

To calculate the total **Focus Cost** of a Power you will use the following:
- **Reactions** add **1** to the Cost for each level.
- **Swift Actions** add **2** to the Cost for each level.
- **Self Range** subtracts **1** from the Cost for each level.
- Each level of a Power adds **2** to the Cost. 
- Each level of each applied Effect adds to the Cost

# Chapter 4: Effects
:
**Effects** are a powerful tool that allow players to customize and enhance their Powers. Each Effect is unique, allowing players to flavor it in any way they wish, and can add special abilities to a Power that would not normally be possible.

While many Effects can be used with any Power, some Effects have restrictions on which Powers they can be used with. This is to balance the strength of the Effect against the type of Power it is used with. For example, the "Continuous" Effect cannot be used with Prowess Powers, as it represents an ongoing condition rather than a physical ability.

When adding an Effect to a Power an additional **Focus Cost** will also be added, depending on which Effect you add.  Unless otherwise stated, any **DC** added by an Effect will begin at **10 + your Ability Score Modifier**.

#### Leveling Up Effects
:
Each newly applied Effect starts at **Level 1**, and has a Focus Cost listed beside their name.  The Focus Cost will double with each subsequent Level added.

If a player chooses to remove an Effect or reduce the Level of an upgraded Effect, they will not be refunded any of the XP they have already spent on upgrading that Effect. Any Power that has an Effect removed or reduced in Level will also have its Level reduced by the same amount. This allows players to adjust their Powers as needed, but at a cost.

#### Effect Categories
- **Attacks**:  Effects that are inherently offensive in nature, deal damage, or enable damage to be dealt.
- **Defense and Buffs**: Effects that are inherently defensive in nature, reduce and prevent damage, or actively boost an aspect of your target's character.

- **Debuffs**: Effects that actively weaken an aspect of your target's character over a specific duration before wearing off.
- **Conditions**: Semi-permanent flaws given to your target that last until fixed, cured, healed, or otherwise removed.
- **Triggers**:  Effects that only activate when specific circumstances are met, but do not otherwise cost additional Focus.
- **Special**: Effects that do not fit into normal categories due to their unique nature, often directly affecting the world around you in addition to or instead of a specific target.
- **Elements**: A series of Effects based on elemental abilities.

# Chapter 5: Items and Equipment (Work In Progress)

### Weapon Creation

##### Step 1:  Pick a size

#### Unarmed: 
Punches, kicks, bites, headbutts, tailwhips, you hit em with your bits and deal
**1d4** damage. **Unarmed** attackers can spend **Focus** to add more **Basic Attacks** to their turn at a cost of **2 Focus** per extra **Attack**.                 

#### Small:
Think daggers, garrote, slings, anything you could concieveably fit in a decent sized pocket or under a cloak, don't be stupid.  

**Small** ranged weapons can a target hit within **15** squares. 

**Small** weapons deal **1d4** damage, and can **Attack** twice per turn.  They can be wielded alongside a **Shield**, or another **Small** or **Medium** weapon.

#### Medium:
 Longswords, battleaxes, rifles, longbows, the kind of weapon you'd hang off your belt or easily strap to your back.

**Medium** ranged weapons can hit a target within **30** squares, but cannot **Attack** adjacent **Squares**.

They deal **1d8** damage and can be wielded alongside a **Shield** or **Small** weapon.

Alternatively a **Medium** weapon can have the **Reach** property to hit **2 Squares** away.
#### Large:
Greatswords, mauls, halberds, pikes, heavy crossbows, weapons that require careful handling in battle to not accidentally murder an ally.  

**Large** ranged weapons can hit within **10** squares, but cannot **Attack** adjacent **Squares**.

**Large** weapons deal **1d12** damage and can re-roll all **1**'s. They require both hands to use, therefore they cannot be used alongside a **Shield** or another weapon.

Alternatively a **Large** weapon can have the **Reach** property to hit up to **3 Squares** away, but cannot hit an adjacent **Square**.

:
***Note**: Any weapon that is Thrown will count as Ranged for that Action.*


\column

### Armor Creation

##### Step 1: Pick a size

#### Unarmored:
You're practically naked, you maniac you.  Just wandering about in your fancy dress clothes in the middle of a battle?  Wearing naught but a stitch, depending on lace and silks to defend you?  Well all you get is **1d4** and you'd best be happy with it.  

While **Unarmored** you can utilize your lighter and unimpeded movements to add to your **Defense** by spending **3 Focus** for each additional die. 

#### Light:
Padded armor, leather, chain shirts, robes, your uncle's lucky vest, light armors are protection you can move about freely in.  Wearing **Light Armor** will add **1d6** to your **Defense**.

#### Medium:
Breastplates, chainmail, scale mail, hide, and ballistic armor are all examples of sturdy **Medium Armor**.  While wearing **Medium Armor** add **1d8** to your **Defense**. All **Powers** and **Free Actions** will cost **1** additional **Focus**.


#### Heavy:
Plate mail, splint mail, banded mail, or an EOD suit are all **Heavy Armor**, designed to take as much punishment as possible.  When wearing **Heavy Armor** add **1d10** to your **Defense**.  All **Powers** and **Free Actions** will cost **2** additional **Focus**.

#### Shields:
Any character may also choose to carry a **Shield** or similar defensive tool in their off-hand, increasing their **Defenses** further.
- **Light Shields** will add **1d4** to your **Defense**.  If used as a **Weapon** it will deal **1d3** damage.

- **Medium Shields** will add **1d8** to your **Defense**, but all **Powers** and **Free Actions** will cost **1** additional **Focus**.  If used as a **Weapon** it will deal **1d6** damage.

- **Heavy Shields** will add **1d12** to your **Defense**, but all **Powers** and **Free Actions** will cost **2** additional **Focus**.  If used as a **Weapon** it will deal **1d10** damage.

##### Step 2: Put it on

### Item and Tech Creation

**Items** and **Tech** are, for the purposes of these tests, interchangeable terms.  **Tech** will later on refer to created pieces of equipment or technology that falls outside the normal bounds of **Item** usage.

**Items** have **Ranks**, they also have a **Rarity**, denoting how powerful an **Item** they are and how many **Upgrades** they may have.

Items can have 4 different Rarities:
* **Common**: The most easily found **Items** for a given **Rank**.
* **Uncommon**: **Items** that are in short supply.
* **Rare**: **Items** that are difficult to find and are often very expensive.
* **Legendary**: These **Items** are extremely difficult to find and have exceptional strength.




There are four types of **Items** that can be made:

#### **Expendable Items**

These **Items** may only be used a single time.  Typically this type describes things like magic scrolls or potions.  
:
**Expendable Items** have a number of **Upgrades** equal to **1/2** their **Rarity** in **d6s**.

* An **E Rank Uncommon Expendable Item** would have **3d6 Upgrades**.
* A **C Rank Rare Expendable Item** would have **12d6 Upgrades**.

#### Charged Items

These **Items** carry a set number of uses and may only be used that many times.  These **Items** are typically wands.
:
**Charged Items** have a number of **Upgrades** equal to **1.5x** their **Rarity**.  They have **1d8** uses for each **Rank** of the **Item**.
* A **D Rank Rare Charged Item** would have **18 Upgrades** and up to **4d8** uses.
* An **A Rank Common Charged Item** would have **18 Upgrades** and up to **7d8** uses.

{{note
Extra notes I don't have a place for yet:

**Items** do not have a **Focus Cost**.

**Legendary Items** only appear at **Rank C** or higher.



}}

\column
::

#### Rechargable Items

These **Items** have a very low number of uses that will recharge over time.
:
**Rechargeable Items** have a number of **Upgrades** equal to their **Rarity** and have **1** use per day for each **Rank** of the **Item**.
* A **C Rank Common Rechargable Item** would have **8 Upgrades** and up to **5** uses per day.
* A **B Rank Legendary Rechargable Item** would have **54 Upgrades** and up to **6** uses per day.

#### Permanent Items

These **Items** do not have a limit to how many times they can be used.
:
**Permanent Items** have a number of **Upgrades** equal to **1/2** their **Rarity**.
* An **F Rank Uncommon Permanent Item** would have **2 Upgrades**.
* A **D Rank Rare Permanent Item** would have **6 Upgrades**.
:
### Creating an Item
To create a new **Item** you will first pick a type and then take the following steps:

#### Step 1:
- Spend **10 Focus** per **Rank** of the **Item** you want to create, and **3 XP**.  It will take a full day to attempt creating a new **Item**.
#### Step 2:
- Roll a **Skill Check** to attempt to create a new **Item**. It will be a **Herculean DC** for the **Rank** of the **Item**.
#### Step 3:
- Determine the **Rarity** of a created **Item** by rolling **1d10**.
- A result of **1-5** will make a **Common Item**.
- A result of **6-8** will make an **Uncommon Item**.
- A result of **9-10** will make a **Rare Item**.
- To create a **Legendary Item** you mus---

Recreating a **Common** or **Uncommon** **Item** you have already made takes **1/2** a day and requires a **Complicated DC** and **Focus**, but does not require **XP** to be spent.

**Rare** and **Legendary Items** always require a **Herculean DC**, **XP**, and a full day to be created.

# Chapter 6: Combat


### What can I do?
On any given turn, you may perform the following:

#### Movement
You may move up to your total **Speed** on your turn, and may move through allies **Squares**, but not through enemies **Squares** without use of a **Power**.

#### Actions
You have **1 Action** available to use on your turn.  It can be used to **Attack**, **Defend**, or use a **Power**.

##### Attacks
- **Attacks** are directed at **Squares**, not at characters.  A character in a **Square** during an incoming **Attack** will be the **Target** of that **Attack** and can then **Defend** themselves. A character that **Moves** or is **Moved** from the associated **Square** will be missed. 
- The **Attacking** character declares any **Focus** to be spent along with the **Basic Attack** or **Power** being used, and then totals the rolled dice + **Modifiers**.
- The **Defending** character may then choose to spend any amount of **Focus** and use their **Armor** or a **Power**.  These dice are totalled with their **Modifiers**.
- Subtract the **Attack** total from the **Defense** total to determine damage dealt.
- If any damage is dealt to the target(s), any **Effects** from that **Attack** or **Power** will succeed.


##### Defending
- Instead of **Attacking** a character may declare they are **Defending** themselves or an adjacent ally.  After picking which target to **Defend**, declare any **Focus** to be spent along with the **Armor** or **Power** being used, and then total the rolled dice + modifiers.
- When **Defending** another character with your **Armor** you may also choose to redirect incoming **Attacks** to you.
- Note that while **Powers** will be usable to **Defend** yourself or others, any applied effects will be used on whatever you target, and so attempting to **Defend** an ally with a debilitating **Effect** will cause them to be struck by it.

##### Free Actions
You have **1 Free Action** available to use for performing a **Skill**, **Grappling**, using an **Item** or piece of **Tech** (if appropriate to the setting), or anything else appropriate to the situation or scenario.  

After using a **Free Action** your next use will consume your **Action** for the turn.

#### Skills
You may attempt to use any one **Skill** on your turn as a **Free Action**.

#### Grapple
You may attempt to grab and hold an opponent if you have at least one free hand.  If your **Prowess** is higher than theirs, you succeed.  While **Grappled** an opponent cannot **Move** or use a **Movement Power** to leave a square adjacent to you.  They can attempt to break free by making a **Prowess DC** or **Fortitude DC**.  While **Grappled** or **Grappling** you cannot **Defend** against targets not part of the **Grapple**.

#### Use an Item or Tech

You may use one **Item** or piece of **Tech** your character possesses per turn as a **Free Action**.
::
### The Combat Sequence
## 1: 
- To begin **Combat**, each side rolls **1d6**. The winning side chooses to go first or second, with ties in favor of the **Players**. 
* Each side may progress their **Turn** in whatever order they wish. 
- Whichever side goes second in the **Turn** has a **+1** to their roll for the next **Round**.  

## 2: 
- At the beginning of each character's turn, any ongoing detrimental or helpful **Effects** will happen, and then the character may attempt to resolve them if possible.

## 3: 
- During their **Turn**, a character can **Move** and/or perform an **Action**, alongside any **Free Actions** they have available.


## 4: 
- Once that character has finished, the next character begins their turn and so on.  Once all **Players** or **NPCs** have gone, the **Turn** switches and play continues until the **Round** or **Combat** ends.
* Once the round has ended, each team rolls **1d6** and begins again.



{{note
If a character has multiple **Actions** per **Turn**, it is entirely up to them which order they use them in, if at all.
